# Ipify Action
_Stefan Arentz, June 2022_

This [LaunchBar Action](https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html) calls the [Ipify](https://www.ipify.org) API to discover your external IPv4 and IPv6 address. You can can easily pass that to other actions or just hit `Command-C` to copy the one you need.
